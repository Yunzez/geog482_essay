# Geog458 final essay

- introduction<br/>
   the project I will be analyzing on is [Washington state emergency operations Center Dashboard](https://waseocgis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=84b17c2a2af8487f97a244b6126834c2). I came across this project when I am looking for data for my final project and it is a large and complcated. I think it would be meaningful and interesting to analyze this project. 
   the goal of this project is to provide WA residents or whoever stays in WA state with helpful information about emergencies or daily information like weather or condition of a road. As mentioned earlier, it is a complicated portal and it serves a lot of functions. It has several large sections: 
   - wildfire -include wind and wildfire information and alerts
   - WebEOC Shelters -shows the location of statewild shelters
   - Air Quality -reports airquality of each area of the world
   - WSDOT Traffic alerts map -reports road accessibility(closed or not)
   - WA Department of Health COVID Tracker -shows covid cases in the state
   - John Hopkins COVID-19 -cite to the JHU covid-19 dashboard
   - Earthquake -shows earthquakes of last week, national wide
   - Flood -reports possible floods
   - Limited English Proficiency -shows the areas in WA with limited english proficiency
   - Weather outlooks -shows the weather of all counties in WA
   - One Stop Shop Traffic -retrive CCTV data of the road and show detailed information of each segment of road
Based on the section it has, this project is suitable for all the people in the world as part of its section provide data of the world, especially on the air quality and covid trackers. For the author of the project, it would be the government of Washington state. However, each subsection has different author and they belong to different organization as the dashborad employ their work and combine them to create this dashboard.
